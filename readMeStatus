- Here's where I left off with development
'- Form input validation(sessionEditTableView, InvoiceTableView)
    - Added a custom view which included a date picker, for date, and picker view for number input
        - Date picker is working properly
        - number picker is working
        - Number picker is currently displaying only single digits
            - need to have the picker show two components(i.e. hours, or dollars and cents)
        - Setup number picker to invoice view.

- Empty Profile forms displays "(null)"
- On first launch, the settings profile form should be displayed
- Project create should include button to start a session.
