////Bugs////////////
- Here's where I left off with development
'- Form input validation(sessionEditTableView, InvoiceTableView)
    - Added a custom view which included a date picker, for date, and picker view for number input
        - Date picker is working properly
        - number picker is working
        - Number picker is currently displaying only single digits
            - need to have the picker show two components(i.e. hours, or dollars and cents)
        - Setup number picker to invoice view.

- Empty Profile forms displays "(null)"
- On first launch, the settings profile form should be displayed
- Project create should include button to start a session.

- PDF Exporter view "Done" button is not working. could be because of some cleanup work.

////Enhancements ///////
	- Remove tabs, and change clients table view to collection view, and add client and settings cell
		- do the same with project table, and anywhere else where there's a finite number of cells
	- If no profile exists when creating invoice, user should be taken to the profile settings view, in addition to displaying alert.
	- App Icon
		- Use simple clock or gear with dollar sign in middle
	- Add NUI to app, and work with styling
	- Clean up model classes...they are a bit of a mishmash.

////Advertisements //////
	- Add banner to each view
	- Add full view interstitial when user creates an invoice.
