////Bugs////////////
- Form input validation(sessionEditTableView, InvoiceTableView)
    - In custom view which includes a date picker, for date, and picker view for number input
        - Number picker is currently displaying only single digits
            - need to have the picker show two components(i.e. hours, or dollars and cents)
        - Add number picker to invoice view.

- PDF Exporter view "Done" button is not working. could be because of some cleanup work.

////Enhancements ///////
	- Change project table to collection view, and anywhere else where there's a finite number of cells
	- If no profile exists when creating invoice, user should be taken to the profile settings view, in addition to displaying alert.
	- App Icon
		- Use simple clock or gear with dollar sign in middle
	- Add NUI to app, and work with styling
	- Project create should include button to start a session.
	- On first launch, prompt to complete settings profile
	- Update model classes...Maybe try NSManagedObject with core data?

////Advertisements //////
	- Implement AdMob(with pm_sales account!)
	- Add banner to each view
	- Add full view interstitial when user creates an invoice.
